# intercom

A low-latency full-duplex intercom. Two or more intercom users will be
able (the project is still unfinished) to communicate (audio and
video) in real-time (with a minimal latency) using a _room_ defined in
a public server. All communications are Peer-to-Peer (P2P).

<!-- ## Platform

The software is written in Python 3, and therefore, you should be able
to run it in any machine where a Python 3 interpreter is available.

## Intercom without data-flow control.
